*What*
A simple Discord bot to promote a healthy and active server.

*Why*
There were a few features that I specifically wanted and found that I required multiple bots to achieve this. I think my OCD kicked in and it seemed like a good idea to aggregate them.

*Features*
- Temporary voice and text channels creation/deletion.
- Polls.
- The ability to follow multiple social media channels (twitter and youtube currently, twitch and instagram to follow).
- Can be self hosted (a good use for a spare raspberry pi).
- Google search that returns the top result.
- Reddit Rhythm Roulette integration (provides three songs to be used as samples)
- Meme of the day (`r/meme`)

*Future features*
- weekly quiz with a prize!
- Gaming news
- News on video games betas
- News on free games (Epic..etc)
- Patch notes for certain video games.

*Requirements*
`discord.js v13` requires `node v16.6+`

`pm2` for process management and `./ecosystem.config.js` for tokens.
`./config.json` for user specific details.

*Usage*
